## How to use the files

To obtain the specified plot, either download or fork the repository 
to your local drive, then execute (using `source()` is highly recommended)
the desired code in your R console. Each plot is summarized by a function, 
which takes as an input argument the working directory where you want the 
resulting files (PNG, ZIP and TXT files) to be stored.

The code will verify if the zip file “exdata_plotting1.zip“ exists,
and download it otherwise.
